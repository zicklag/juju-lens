test readme change

Juju Lens is a new web GUI for the [Juju] orchestration tool with a beautiful interface and support for multiple controllers. Juju Lens is under heavy development, but is usable right now ( see the Getting Started section below ). If you have any ideas or feedback let us know on the [Juju Forum][jf] by creating a topic in the [UX & Design category][jf]. You can also open a GitHub issue.

## Getting Started

To get started, you don’t need to install anything! ( assuming you already have a Juju controller to connect to. ) Just go to the [Juju Lens App][juju_lens], add one or more controllers, and you’re all set. All data is stored locally in your browser, so if you access the Lens from a different browser you will have to re-add your controllers.

Juju Lens will connect to your controller and display the number of machines, models, applications, and units in the controller list. Then click on the models tab:
